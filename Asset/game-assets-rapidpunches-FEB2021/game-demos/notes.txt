(These "demos" are just for displaying sprites and are not actual games in development).

I learn things little by little as I go.
For example, I used to import TIC-80 sprites one at a time and move them into place, but now I export, edit, and import the whole sprite sheet.

I'm still learning workflow.

I hope to become better at programming to become better at making assets for game developers like you!

This folder is for showing you my progress. I've been looking at tutorials and following them as best I can.
