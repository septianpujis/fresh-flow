Hello! My work is free to use!
I appreciate being credited. It will help spread the use of marine life sprites when you do.
As I continue to make more assets, people will want to check back with me to get more :)

Thank you for supporting my work!

If you need anything else, or if you just have marine life requests, feel free to contact me!
